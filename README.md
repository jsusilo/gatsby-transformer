### An exploration of the javascript ecosystem in Gatsby

#### Demo at [https://using-javascript-transforms.netlify.com](https://using-javascript-transforms.netlify.com)

The example mixes javascript and remark, uses scss and bulma.io, has use case
examples for graphql in layouts, and some "manual" page creation with the help
of the jsFrontmatter transformer aka gatsby-transformer-static-exports.
